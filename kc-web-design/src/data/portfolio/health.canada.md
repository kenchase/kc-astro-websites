## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Accessibility-First Design**

- Modernized legacy HTML and PDF forms to meet WCAG 2.0 AA standards
- Integrated Government of Canada Web Experience Toolkit (WET) requirements
- **Simplified complex regulatory forms** while maintaining compliance and functionality
- Created accessible form patterns with clear feedback and error handling

### **Complex Prototype Development**

- Built interactive prototypes spanning 20+ screens with multiple user flows
- Implemented conditional logic for dynamic form sections based on user selections
- Developed expand/collapse functionality and progressive disclosure patterns
- Created functional HTML/CSS/JavaScript code for developer implementation

### **Legacy System Modernization**

- Transformed complex Java applications into modern web interfaces
- Redesigned multi-step regulatory submission processes
- Simplified complex policy requirements into user-friendly form patterns
- Balanced regulatory compliance with improved user experience

## üöÄ **Strategic Approach**

### **Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration**

- **Facilitated alignment** across directors, product managers, developers, and accessibility reviewers
- **Conducted regular stakeholder presentations** using Figma prototypes for virtual meetings
- **Gathered comprehensive requirements** from product managers with deep policy expertise
- **Translated complex regulatory needs** into accessible user interface patterns

### **Design System Innovation**

- **Pioneered Figma adoption** within government environment lacking design system maturity
- **Developed reusable component library** to accelerate future design iterations
- **Created design-to-development bridge** by providing functional code prototypes
- **Established accessible design patterns** for complex government forms

### **Process Innovation & Problem-Solving**

- **Identified stakeholder and developer pain points** through active listening and observation
- **Adapted design process and deliverables** to meet organizational needs beyond standard scope
- **Overcame resistance through evidence-based design decisions** and prototype demonstrations
- **Provided logical, well-researched explanations** when stakeholder suggestions conflicted with WCAG/WET requirements
- **Advanced Figma utilization** to bridge design-development gaps and improve team efficiency
