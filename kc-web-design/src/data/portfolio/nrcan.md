## 🌍 **National Impact Context**

**About the Projects:** GEO.ca serves as Canada's central platform for discovering and accessing geospatial data across all government levels. The flood mapping initiative supports emergency management for Canada's most costly natural disaster, with flooding causing over $1 billion in annual damage. These systems enable critical decision-making for land use planning, emergency response, and climate change adaptation.
