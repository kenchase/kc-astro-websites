## Technical Implementation

### Accessibility-First Design

- Modernized and simplified legacy HTML and PDF forms to meet WCAG 2.0 AA standards.
- Transformed complex Java applications into modern web interfaces.
- Integrated Government of Canada Web Experience Toolkit (WET) requirements.
- Created accessible forms with clear feedback and error handling.

### Complex Prototype Development

- Built interactive Figma prototypes with up to 20+ screens to demonstrate, test, and validate complex user flows.
- Created functional HTML/CSS/JavaScript code for developer implementation.

## Strategic Approach

### Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration

- **Facilitated alignment** across directors, product managers, developers, and accessibility reviewers.
- **Conducted regular stakeholder presentations** using Figma prototypes during meetings.
- **Gathered comprehensive requirements** from product managers with deep policy expertise.
- **Translated complex regulatory needs** into accessible user interface patterns.

### Design System Innovation

- **Pioneered Figma adoption** within government environment lacking design system maturity.
- **Developed reusable component library** to accelerate future design iterations.
- **Created design-to-development bridge** by providing functional code prototypes.
- **Established accessible design patterns** for complex government forms.

### Process Innovation & Problem-Solving

- **Identified stakeholder and developer pain points** through active listening and observation.
- **Adapted design process and deliverables** to meet organizational needs beyond standard scope.
- **Overcame resistance through evidence-based design decisions** and prototype demonstrations.
- **Provided logical, well-researched explanations** when stakeholder suggestions conflicted with WCAG/WET requirements.
- **Advanced Figma utilization** to bridge design-development gaps and improve team efficiency.
