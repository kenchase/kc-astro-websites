          <p>I'm a Canadian web designer, creative photographer, and musician based in Ottawa, Ontario. I'm fluent in both English and French which comes in handy, especially when I ran away to live in the Caribbean for a couple of years.</p>
          <p>I'm someone who thinks the best adventures happen on foot while the best ideas come from slowing down and paying attention.</p>
          <p>I'm both a night owl and a morning person—a contradiction that I somehow make work: I've mastered the art of napping!</p>

          <p>I strive to create cinematic street photography that captures how I view the world. My work was initially heavily influenced by film noir, but over time it's taking on a life of its own. I've also embraced colour.</p>
          <p>Walking gives me the time to see what others sometimes miss—the atmosphere, the mood, the textures, the unfolding stories. There's a lot to see out there when you choose to look.</p>
          <p>My photos are little love letters to the cities I walk.</p>

          <p>I turn overheard conversations into songs—those random snippets of life that catch my ear while walking around the city, sitting in cafes, restaurants, and bars.</p>
          <p>My music ranges from experimental electronic sounds to bedroom rock, but I like to think of it all as <span class="dotted-border">apartment songs</span></p>
          <p>I write, record, and produce from my home studio surrounded by the instruments I adore.</p>
